Neo4j AWS Intro Tutorial Trainers Pack
======================================

Note: This is _very_ cut down version of the standard Neo4j Intro Tutorial, which
has also been adapted to use AWS for deployment of Neo4j

Contents:

* `Neo4j AWS Intro Tutorial.key` - Keynote presentation (this is the master).
* `Neo4j AWS Intro Tutorial.pdf` - PDF export of selected slides, to be provided
  to students AFTER the tutorial.
* `docs` - Documents that should be printed before the class
* `sample` - Contents of this directory are used by the puppet scripts.
* `conf` - Contents of this directory are used by the puppet scripts.

Preparation:

* Provide students with printouts of the Cypher cheat-sheet, found
  in `docs/Neo4j_CheatSheet_v?.pdf`
* Provide students with printouts of the movie graph model, found
  in `docs/movies_model.pdf`
* Ensure a whiteboard is available. Ideally, project the presentation onto
  the whiteboard, to allow drawing over projected images.
* Ensure it's easy to switch between the presentation slides and using neo4j
  to demonstrate the examples. Note that examples can be copy/pasted from the
  slides.
* Customise your Keynote presenters display to show a large area for the notes
